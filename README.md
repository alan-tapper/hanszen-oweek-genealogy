The Hanszen O-Week Geneology Project aims to document the complex family tree of O-Week families at Hanszen.

This site does not use any external family tree software, as those cannot handle all the relationships that are needed for this network to work. Specifically, the Hanszen "family tree" is not a tree.

The structure of the tree is as follows. During O-Week, new students are placed in O-Week groups. An O-Week group at Hanszen consists of around 10 new students and 4 advisors (at least sophomores). The groups are made such that no two advisors in a group are immediately "related", i.e. one was not the other's advisor and they were not in the same group when they were new students. A person's immediate family is their advisors (also called parents), the other new students in their group (siblings), and if they advised then the students they advised for (children), and the other advisors in their group (cos).


Features

Find the path between any two people in the network, with the option to consider only "blood relations," i.e. parents, children, siblings
Explore the family around any specific person


If you want someone to be added, email amt15@rice.edu with the person to be added and a list of everyone (that you know of) in their O-Week Group. Also email if something you see is incorrect, or if you have any other suggestions. Thanks for helping expand the network!
